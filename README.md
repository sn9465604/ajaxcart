Shopify Ajax Cart Custom Product notify

Here is the product that we would want to trigger the text in the cart https://nailpulse.com/products/3-in-1-gel-polish-pen

I need it to say "add 2 more colors to unlock your free UV light" when the quantity of the product is 1. Then i need it to change to "just 1 more color for a free UV light" when the quantity of the product is 2. And then have it says "Congrats! You'll be recieving a free UV Light" once they have 3 of the product in their cart.
